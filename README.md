## Overview

**epispot** is an R package for parallel variational
expectation-maximisation in sparse regression with
hierarchically-related responses and predictor-level information. A
notable application is in the context of molecular quantitative trait
locus mapping, with several thousand molecular levels (responses),
genetic markers (candidate predictors) and epigenetic annotation marks
(predictor-level covariates) and individuals (samples).
