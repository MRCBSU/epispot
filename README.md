## EPISPOT â€“ annotation-driven approach for large-scale joint regression with multiple responses

## Overview

**epispot** is an R package for parallel variational expectation-maximisation in 
sparse regression with hierarchically-related responses and predictor-level 
information. A notable application is in the context of molecular quantitative 
trait locus mapping, with several thousand molecular levels (responses), genetic 
markers (candidate predictors) and epigenetic annotation marks (predictor-level 
covariates) and individuals (samples).
