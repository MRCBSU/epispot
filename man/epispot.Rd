\description{
Variational approximation procedure fitting sparse multivariate regression
models for combined selection of predictors and associated responses in
high-dimensional set-ups. Dependence across responses linked to the same
predictors is captured through the model hierarchical structure.
The responses can be purely continuous, purely binary (logit or probit link
fits), or a mix of continuous and binary variables.
}
\details{
The optimization is made using efficient block coordinate ascent schemes, for
which convergence is ensured as the objective (elbo) is multiconcave
for the selected blocks, i.e., it is concave in each block of parameters
whose updates are made simultaneously, see Wu et al. (reference Section
below).

The continuous response variables in \code{Y} (if any) will be centered
before application of the variational algorithm, and the candidate predictors
and covariates resp. in \code{X} and \code{Z} will be standardized. An
intercept will be added if \code{link} is \code{"logit"}, \code{"probit"} or
\code{"mix"} (do not supply it in \code{X} or \code{Z}).
